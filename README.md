# 2021-our-participants
A datavisualization project showing the diversity of our participants and their work

This repository is a work in progress, hence the todo notes. You can run the project locally using `npm run dev`


## Updating the website
Make changes in main, pull to website branch and push from there to update the website.
**When updating the website branch, make sure the docs folder isn't gitignored.**

## Todo

### Laurens
- Nice to have: larger popout versions of images on mouseover (with max width and height)
- Nice to have: different css for large screens so the icons and photos are a bit bigger (looks like the CCDL website has a max content width of 1200)
- Host project somewhere.
	+ I've hosted it on Github Pages using the website branch. Pushing to that branch will update the website.
	+ Remaining issue is that the CCDL website is not HTTPS so it wont be able to iframe github pages for now. They should prob get HTTPS sorted...

## Resources
I've used [this example](https://svelte.dev/repl/9c5a422b0dfd4c43a7cd7fd807cdbb1c?version=3.24.0) to get the flip animation to work.
